Eight years of public school education with the same eighty kids, entire units on the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, memorizing maps of the Soviet bloc countries, an interactive unit on the Oregon Trail (not particularly "woke" as it was the 1980s and suburban schools were still sleeping soundly)...and finally, FINALLY, we got to India.</p></blockquote>

The fact that I disagreed with Truschke's white-washing of Aurangzeb (a Mughal tyrant who murdered nearly half a million Hindus), her persistence in equating Hinduism with Nazism, and the refusal of Rutgers to engage sufficient dissenting scholarly voices was "proof" that I am an Islamophobic Hindu fascist.</p></blockquote>
