### Hey! Here's a brief introduction to what I do:


The aim of this account is to provide the truth. We live in a world where information recognises no geographical boundaries, where one can live in India and read about the Western narrative of Indian affairs – which is often lacking in any real understanding. We live in a world where most Indian news outlets are dedicated to the "left" and the "right" – making the news increasingly polarised. We live in a world where misinformation spreads far faster than the truth –- making it increasingly difficult to know what is real and what is not. 

​

For those reasons, I strive to provide the truth. The way I see it, there are three big types of falsehoods, the first being half-truths (presenting one side of an argument), the second being misinformation, and the third being reporting bias. I seek to refute, or rebut, such falsehoods. That may involve presenting the side that is often ignored by the mainstream media, or by presenting both sides of an argument in an unbiased manner.
