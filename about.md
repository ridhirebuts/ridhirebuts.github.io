We live in a world where most Indian news outlets are dedicated to the "left" and the "right" – making the news increasingly polarised. We live in a world where misinformation spreads far faster than the truth –- making it increasingly difficult to know what is real and what is not. 

I am Ridhi. Kashmiri and a freelance journalist studying Cultural Studies and linguistic heritage of Kashmir.
