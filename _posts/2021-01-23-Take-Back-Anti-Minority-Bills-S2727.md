    The New York Senate has proposed a bill that blatantly ignores and marginalizes minorities. Senate Bill S2727 violates the equal representation that all Americans, including minorities, deserve to have.

  Dear Senators,

In a bill before the NY state senate, Bill S2727, there is a proposition for statewide instruction of the noose as a hate symbol in our public schools. This is long overdue, and we all support the Noose being labelled and taught as such. We are confident that many other states will respect this decision and follow suit. Along with the noose the symbol referred to as a “Swastika” is also included in this “hate symbol education”.
To teach the “Swastika”, as a hate symbol is Ill-informed and detrimental to MANY minorities who continue to use it today. The children belonging to these cultures attend the public school system.
To pass this bill would be a clear violation of equal representation as this bill continues to marginalize minorities that belong to (but are not limited to):
Indonesia, Japan, Tibet, China, Korean, Cambodia, Bali, Fiji, Trinidad, Guyana, Ghana, Ethiopia, Congo, South African, Nigeria, Eritrea, Kenyan, Sri Lanka, India, Nepali, Vietnam, Native Americans of many tribes, Mexico and various Central American backgrounds; who still actively use these symbols across religious, spiritual and humanitarian practices.
It Would be CORRECT to teach the “Svastika” (no ‘w’), “Manji”, “Dharma Wheel”, “  “Tsil no’oli’ or Whirling log”, “Kode Emowar Ewa”, “Nkotimsefuopua”, as a symbol of peace, unity and prosperity.  (these various names for the same symbol are a sample of a few)
It is expected that the respective names, of this perfectly geometric shape, will be introduced as instructional material under the corresponding educational chapters and units referencing the respective cultures practices, textiles, architectures and artefacts; ancient and modern. All these must be included in the curriculum otherwise this is a biased and unfair bill.  
Any education pertaining to the “Swastika as a hate symbol” is unfactual, false and blatantly ignores the religious beliefs and cultural practices of many children who attend our public school system. Therefore we are moving to strike all mentions of the “Swastika” or “Swastik” or any other above terms that do not pertain to Hitler's use;  that correlate to Nazi Germany and hate symbols.
It is correct to ONLY use the word “HAKENKREUZ” to identify the Nazi use of this symbol to be taught as HATE. This is the ONLY term that Adolf Hitler used in his book and  “ hooked cross” this is the ACTUAL literal translation from German to English.
Children deserve to learn history in its entirety.

Thank you.
