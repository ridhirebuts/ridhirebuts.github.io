title: Jammu & Kashmir in June
---

A lot happened. 

## June 12th

  

Two policemen and two civilians were killed, with multiple people injured when terrorists opened fire on a Sopore police station team.

  

## June 17th

  

Former Kashmiri police officer Javaid Ahmad was shot dead by terrorists near his home in Srinagar.

  

He was unarmed.

  

## June 22nd

  

Police inspector Parvaiz Ahmad Dar was shot at while he was going to offer prayers at a mosque in Srinagar's Menganwaji Nowgam area.

  

He is survived by his wife, a 13-year-old daughter, and a 10-year-old son.

  

## June 24th

  

PM Modi held a meeting with the leaders of J&K for the first time since Article 370 was revoked.

  

The PM assured Kashmir’s leaders that the Centre was “committed to reviving the democratic

process through Assembly elections as early as possible and sought their participation in the delimitation exercise.”
  

When the issue of restoring Article 370 was brought up, according to the Indian Express, sources said that the government took the stand that the matter was sub judice and the Supreme Court would take a decision on it.

  

## June 26th

  

A specially-abled 18 year old Sikh girl was allegedly abducted at gunpoint, forcibly converted and married off to a 62-year old man. On June 26th, the girl was brought to the Srinagar High Court along with the family of the old man. The girl’s family was told that she had been married to the old man and would be returned to the family by the end of the day.

  

However, on Saturday night, the Court declared the marriage valid, sparking protests amongst the Sikh community.

  

Protests have also spread to Delhi amidst further revelations of forcible conversions and marriages, and a few Sikh leaders have called for law mandating parental permission for inter-religious marriages to be implemented in the state.

  

## June 27th

  

Terrorists attacked the Air Force base in Jammu airport, using drones to drop the payload. Two Indian Air Force personnel were injured in the explosions.

  

Elsewhere in Jammu, a crude bomb attack was averted.

  

## **June 27th**

  

Terrorists barged into Special Police Officer Fayaz Ahmed’s house, and fired indiscriminately.

  

Both Ahmad and his wife died from their injuries at night, while their daughter, who had been admitted to Government Medical College, Anantnag, succumbed to her injuries earlier today.

Waiting for the international media to say something, and for the Centre to act on the terrorist attacks.
