title: The PM Said What?! 
---

Quotes and actions of Indian Prime Ministers that reflect the opposite of mainstream narratives. 

Nehru’s an authoritarian, Hindu nationalist, Indira Gandhi is an anti-immigration Hindu nationalist, Rajiv Gandhi is a fascist,  Vajpayee is indecisive, against modern Hindutva and an advocate for free speech, Manmohan Singh hates communism and Pakistan, and Modi is a strong supporter of Muslims worldwide:

  

Nehru:

  

1.  “We cannot tolerate that there should be an English knowing elite and a large mass of our people not knowing English. Therefore, we must have our own language.”
    
2.  “The fact is that our whole organisation has been built up with the view to helping the vast mass of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan. It’s not conditioned to look after Muslims whose cases stand on a somewhat different footing. It may even be that there is not too much sympathy for these Muslims among government departments or outside.”
    
3.  Placed new curbs on the freedom of speech and revalidated the law of sedition.
    

  

Indira Gandhi:

1.  The PM promised a high-level committee of inquiry that would consider the scope of the existing constitutional provisions for cow slaughter and look at their possible amendment.
    
2.  “We will build a new Kashmir, quickly if you help, slowly if you don’t, but build it we will!”
    
3.  “I am absolutely determined that the refugees of all religions must go back. We are not going to absorb them in our population.”
    

  

Rajiv Gandhi:

1.  Banned marijuana
    
2.  Introduced curbs on press freedoms allegedly to stop coverage of a scandal he was involved in.
    
3.  Justified the murder of hundreds by indirectly calling it collateral damage.
    
4.  “We must be clear that secularism as we understand it is not only anti-religion or non-religion; it is only the separation of government from religion. Religion has a great role to play in the development process of our nation and we should do nothing to undermine it.”
    

  

Atal Bihari Vajpayee:

1.  “I accept the Hindutva of Swami Vivekananda but the type of Hindutva being propagated now is wrong and one should be wary of it.”
    
2.  “Wherever Muslims live, they don't like to live in co-existence with others, they don't like to mingle with others; and instead of propagating their ideas in a peaceful manner, they want to spread their faith by resorting to terror and threats.”
    
3.  “The freedom of the press is an integral part of Indian democracy...Persecution on account of one's beliefs and insistence that all must accept a particular point of view is unknown to our ethos.”
    

  

Manmohan Singh:

1.  "State-sponsored cross-border terrorism is of particular concern to India, also on account of the fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is located in our neighbourhood in Pakistan.”
    
2.  Called Naxals the “single biggest internal security challenge”.
    
3.  When asked about the legalisation of homosexual marriages in another country, this PM said it would certainly not be widely appreciated in their country (India).
    

  

Modi:

1.  Received the highest civilian honours from Afghanistan, Palestine and the UAE.
    
2.  Became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Palestine. While there, the PM in question declared support for Palestinian independence and signed a $50 million deal.
    
3.  Said “we must reject any link between terrorism and religion. Those who spread terror in the name of religion are anti-religious,” at a global forum.
    
4.  Launched universal health insurance in Kashmir.
