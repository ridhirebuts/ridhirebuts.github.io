title: Religious Persecution in Pakistan
---

In his first speech before the members of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan in 1947, Mohammad Ali Jinnah said that non-Muslims would be equal citizens in the new country and that every person living in the country would be an equal citizen, irrespective of his or her community, caste, colour, or faith. History is witness to the fact that what Jinnah said was not even remotely accurate as to what would happen.

Minority communities [firstly face discrimination under the Constitution](https://www.refworld.org/pdfid/57fb91e54.pdf). The Constitution of Pakistan, in article 25 (1), guarantees that “all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law.” Article 5 provides that “adequate provision shall be made for the minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures,” and article 33 declares that it is the state’s responsibility to discourage parochial, racial, tribal, sectarian, and provincial prejudices among citizens. However, these provisions have never been fully implemented in practice, and are contradicted by other provisions of the Constitution.
