title: My Experience in Kashmir
---


I am a Kashmiri Pandit. My parents were forced to flee their homes in 1990 because they did not want to convert.

  

In 2018, while I was in Jammu visiting my relatives, my uncle (who works in Kashmir) joked with my mother – "why don’t you send “(my name)” over! “We’ll go skiing together,” he said in Kashmiri.

  

I hadn’t ever gone to Kashmir till then. I was born elsewhere and I wasn’t very optimistic about ever going back. So when my uncle floated the idea, it gripped me. I get to go home. I begged and pleaded with my parents (using all the emotional blackmail that is possible) and eventually, my father cracked. I like to think it’s because he too desperately wanted to go home after 28 years. He booked a flight – we would be going for two days. 48 hours doesn’t seem like much, but to me it was just pure joy.

  

Someday I’ll describe what happened to my paternal and maternal families in 1990, but not today. All you need to know for now is that I have a small extended family because many were killed. Most of the victims came from my maternal side of the family – my mother’s family had seen much loss and they lived in fear. This fear gripped my mother’s family so much so that my mother refused to go back. My mother was against me going back as well, out of fears that I would never return. My grandmother cried and pleaded with me that I don’t go back. I was adamant though. I didn’t quite care if I had died; I wanted to go home. I was however concerned my father would die, given that two Hindu tourists had been killed earlier the year due to stone pelters. But the adrenaline was high, and we went ahead with our plan – despite my grandmother crying a few more times.

Just a few days before, it was my Koshur Vorvhod – my Kashmiri Birthday. Prayers had been done and everyone who had taken part in the puja was wearing a naervin – a sacred red thread around their wrist. Before we left, my father and I removed our naervins. *Lest people find out we are Kashmiri Pandits.*

  

I was excited the morning we left; I documented everything. I took photos and videos of every possible thing and I held onto every physical remnant of the trip. At one point I even tried to sneak a few Chinar leaves into my bag, but my father stopped me.

When we touched down in Srinagar, spirits were high. We were waiting inside the airport for our driver, when we saw Dhananjay Kaul. My father’s a big fan and I wanted to get his autograph for my father, but there was a blackout all of a sudden. The power would come back on within a few minutes, but Dhananjay Kaul had disappeared.


After maybe an hour’s wait, the driver came, and I finally got to see the city of Srinagar – The City of Wealth, the City of the Sun, the Venerable City. I think the first thing that struck me was all the Chinars lining the roads. There were just red leaves everywhere; it was a very beautiful sight.

  

My mother’s family had a small, but beautiful home, near river Vitasta (or Jhelum). My father’s family home was a bit ill-maintained but they were proud to be homeowners, and it was in a bustling district. *Despite the fact that we had two homes in Kashmir, we stayed in a hotel.*

  

As my father checked in, we were given Kehwa – the traditional Kashmiri green tea. It hit me different because I hadn’t really processed the fact that I was in Kashmir. The idea of being in my own homeland seemed so foreign to me, I couldn’t believe I was having Kehwa in any place apart from my house. So naturally I was excited, and I ended up spilling some of it.

  

We went to our hotel room, which opened up to a gigantic common lawn. We dumped our bags and immediately went out. There was this huge Chinar tree there and I just stood there looking up at it – what a pretty tree it was. Then my father told me to turn around, and you know that expression “my jaw dropped”? It’s just always been an idiom for me, but that day, my jaw dropped. Right behind the hotel you could see this beautiful landscape of trees, covered with this eerie fog – adding to the effect. What a view.

When we returned to our room, I turned on the TV, only to be greeted by Farooq Abbdullah’s face. The default setting of the TV was a video of the history of the hotel, which Farooq Abdullah somehow contributed to and so most of the video consisted of him walking around the hotel and narrating its history. The video also delved into the “history of Kashmir” which conveniently left out all the gory details. I remember one part of the video showed a quote by Jahangir, supposedly said when he was asked on his deathbed what his most cherished desire was. He said “Kashmir, the rest is worthless”. The entire video showed Jahangir to be some sort of a messiah and a just ruler. But this was the same man who forced Kashmiri Pandits to marry their daughters to Mughal officers and Subedars.

It was still early in the afternoon, so we decided to go around Srinagar. First, we went to Zestha Devi Mandir, which was relatively close by. I remember driving past Mehbooba Mufti’s huge house, with so many cars lined up outside. We also went past the Governor’s house which was rather heavily guarded.

  

We didn’t spend a lot of time at the Mandir, maybe a little over half an hour. There was no Guruji there, and the Mandir was deserted save for a few college students who were sitting there. They had Tilaks on their foreheads, and I wondered why they were hanging out at a Mandir (it's an odd spot for friends to chit-chat, don't you think?)

  

We then went to the famed Nishat Bagh. There was a small area where people could don the traditional Pheran and get photos taken and so my father and I joined the short queue.

  

The photographer was an amicable Kashmiri Muslim. He was smart – he figured we were Kashmiris but not Kashmiri Muslims. So he asked us “when did we leave” in Kashmiri. I didn’t like that question. “When did we leave” sounded as if my family left Kashmir as if by their free will. He knew when we had left; there was that stupid grin on his face when he asked the question. After I had my photos taken, he began addressing me directly, and he asked me about whether I spoke Kashmiri or not. He spoke really fast and went onto the next question, so I wasn’t able to respond. That was a sad moment for me though, because even though I can swear in Kashmiri and I can respond to that sentence by saying “mya chu koshur tagan” (I know Kashmiri), I couldn’t put together complicated sentences. Since that day, I told myself to make a conscious effort to speak Kashmiri.

  

The other thing I remember about Nishat Bagh was a few big dogs I saw. I remember taking a photo of one and my father asked me what I was taking a photo of. I responded with “the dog”. Normally, my father would make some sarcastic comment, but that day, he just laughed. I don’t think I’ve seen my father as happy as he was in Kashmir before. They were good dogs by the way, I still keep pictures of them.

  

Nishat Bagh is right in front of Dal Lake and there’s a small market opposite as well. My father and I waited there for our driver, and I remember, that was the first time I felt unsafe. This feeling would be repeated in the time to come. My father had already told me to stick close to him, but it was outside that market when I huddled with my father. I could feel people’s eyes boring into me, and I didn’t like it. Eventually, the driver came and I breathed a sigh of relief.

  

Our driver was a friendly, nice (and handsome if I may) young man. He was also a Muslim, and it was the first time I realised that they say certain words differently. I remember him telling us a story; I don’t remember the exact wording of it, but here’s the crux of it:

  

There was a Kashmiri Muslim family comprising of a father, mother and a son. One day, a Kashmiri Pandit goes to their home, and talks with the father at the doorway. Suddenly, the young son runs up to his father and says “Yi chu Koshur Pandit?!” (this is a Kashmiri Pandit?) in a rather confused and exasperated manner.

  

I didn’t get the story, but my father, his friend (who had joined us in the car) and the driver laughed. My father explained to me that some Kashmiri Muslims have made Kashmiri Pandits out to be devils, described them as lesser beings and as the “bad-guys”. So the boy was shocked because the Kashmiri Pandit who was talking to his father looked nothing like what his father had described to him. I guess it is a funny story, but I find it morbid as well.

  

It was my birthday that day (which is one of the reasons I used to emotionally blackmail my parents into letting me go) and so we went back to the hotel and had some cake with my uncle, and a few of my father’s friends. It was a very merry atmosphere, my father was meeting a good friend of his after 28 years, and everyone was just happy to celebrate something.

  

After having cake, we left to go to a restaurant for dinner. I remember my father’s friend asked me to sing a Kashmiri song while we were in the car. I spaced. Nothing came to mind except Kashmiri Leelas. So I told him that I couldn’t remember anything except Kashmiri Leelas. He replied (in Kashmiri) with “those are the best! Nothing to fear, the windows are rolled up!” He’s a fun guy.

  

The restaurant we went to served fusion food, an amalgamation of Ladakhi, Tibetian and Kashmiri food. It was located in a rather shady place and the alley leading up to it was very dark. The restaurant also had dim lighting and there was hardly anyone there. Sort of felt like I was doing something illegal. I do wonder what goes on in that restaurant (apart from the good cooking).

  

The rest of the night was full of fun “bro” moments between my father and his friend. I can only imagine what it feels like to see a good friend after 28 years.

The next morning, we went to Tulmul, one of Kashmir’s most famed temples. It was a fairly long drive and when we exited the car, my feet were a bit numb. But there I was, standing in front of a place I had only ever seen in pictures around my home (there’s one huge painting of Tulmul in my home and one smaller framed picture).

  

Before going to Tulmul, you aren’t allowed to eat eggs or any other non-vegetarian foodstuffs. There’s some other criteria as well, but they aren’t coming to mind. I remember watching people walking within the temple premises, wondering whether they had eaten any egg or non-vegetarian food. They didn’t enter the main temple premises and just walked around in circles; it felt like they were patrolling the temple.

  

Upon entering the main temple premises, we removed our shoes and went to get puja materials. The man selling the materials ran a small shop, and we were his only customers at the moment. My father chatted with him about how this is the first time he has come to Tulmul in 30 years while I took a few photos of the dogs there. 3 puppies and 1 big dog; all excellent dogs.

  

The Guruji applied tilaks for us, we did our prayers and sat around for about an hour. Tulmul’s beautiful and it just has this indecipherable aura of a spiritual place.

I can’t say that we had had our fill, but it was time to go and so we got up to leave and wear our shoes. I remember a rather rabid dog approaching us (not one of the good dogs I had mentioned earlier) and barking at us rather aggressively. Good dog, but scary. I was a mess and had trouble tying my shoelaces as the dog approached. By the time I was done, I was practically running.

  

We hadn’t even left the temple premises yet when my father took out a tissue. *He wiped off his Tilak, and then mine. Why? Because that’s enough to get you shot in Kashmir.* I’ll never forget that. I went to Tulmul, which for a Kashmiri Pandit is the equivalent of the Vatican for a Catholic, and I had to remove any signs of having been there.

We then went to Gulmarg, Kashmir’s ski haven, for the skiing trip my uncle had promised me. The plan was very close to failing. Since it had snowed overnight, the roads had initially been blocked with snow, but it cleared up, and we made our way up the treacherous paths. It was a fun experience and our driver was a good companion. He laughed with me as I fell (often in hilarious ways), he helped me up, he carried our skis when we were too tired and we had snow fights together. My father was very fond of him, and they took a nice photo together there against the backdrop of snow-laden fir trees. Before getting in the car, my uncle and I got into a snow fight and I remember thinking “wow, I’m really bad at this”. But it’s okay. I will go to Kashmir again, and I’ll be better at forming snowballs.

  

My father and I hadn’t gone to Jammu expecting to go to Kashmir, so we hadn’t packed the appropriate clothes. All of my pictures in Kashmir (except for the ones taken at Nishat Bagh) are rather funny because I’m wearing an odd combination of clothes. My shoes weren’t suitable for Gulmarg’s snow, and the cold was biting. So I had to remove my shoes and get new socks to keep my feet warm. I look back at that experience today and consider it to be a fun one, because I got a pair of Kashmiri woolen socks out of it.

  

Next up was Dal Lake. The journey back to Srinagar was long and so we decided to have lunch at a small town somewhere midway. I didn’t even need to look at the menu to know what I wanted to order (Roganjosh, I wanted Roganjosh). But my Uncle told me not to order any non-vegetarian food that wasn’t chicken, saying that they sometimes use beef instead of lamb if they know you are Hindu. So it ended up being chicken for the four of us.

  

Another car ride later, we reached Dal Lake and we got on a shikara. I thought it’d be a rather isolated ride, but we met many along the way:

  

First, we were approached by a man on a shikara selling kehwa. How could we refuse Kahwa? We bought it and he paddled ahead. Then came the man selling vegetables. Gogja, monja, haak, nadur – you could see my father’s face flush with excitement. But my father had planned to purchase the goods elsewhere and so we bid that seller farewell, and he too paddled ahead. The third and final seller was a photographer. He offered to take pictures of us with some props that he had. I didn’t really want to since it involved me having to shift shikaras, but my father thought it’d be fun and we did it anyway.

  

Once all the sellers had left, we just sipped our kehwa and waited for the sun to set – and what a sunset it was. I think the painting of Dal Lake that hangs in my house pales in comparison to the view we had that evening.

We went back to the hotel after that and we had dinner with some of my father’s friends and their apprentices. My father had a good time, talking about politics and home, while I was primarily concerned about why the bowl of Roganjosh had been placed so far away from me. I don’t think I ended up getting to the Roganjosh. The Rista was good though.

The next morning, it was time to leave. We had a few hours before our flight and so we decided to do some final sightseeing with our luggage in the trunk of the car. We went to my father’s university, my mother’s university, one of the nine historical kadals (bridges) and we looked at Shankracharya temple and the Hari Parbat fort from afar.

  

This entire time, my father narrated history in the car. One particular fact stood out. He described how when Muslims wanted places of worship in Kashmir, some of them tore down temples while some held great respect for the temples and so, they retained the pagoda shape of the temples and simply changed the colours from saffron or red to green.

![Pagoda-Shaped Mosque](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ridhirebuts/ridhirebuts.github.io/master/images/IMG_8912.jpeg)

As you enter the city though, the prominence of such mosques decreases. My father said it’s because the Arabs rejected such mosques, and insisted on mosques with domes.

  

Until that morning, we had only been going to fairly tourist areas, or temples. So we hadn’t experienced the “real Kashmir”, if you would. My father wanted to buy some things at a market though, and so we entered “the real Kashmir”.

  

We went to a market near Dal Lake and that’s when I saw a police officer, with his gun ready, at the junction. It didn’t feel like the “heavy military” that's often described but I’m sure that there would be more officers in the more volatile areas of Kashmir. Nevertheless, that did strike me as different. Moments later though, I noticed that the officer was directly opposite shops that were flagrantly displaying the Pakistani flag. It wasn’t one shop, it was multiple. My father and I looked at each other, worried. But this was apparently the norm, and nothing happened, except our faces turned red in anger. The same country that sent and trained terrorists to butcher my people – that’s who they want to join.

  

That experience was also something I would go on to use to describe media coverage of Kashmir. Western media and some Indian media outlets will show you the officer, with gun pointed. But they won’t show you the other half. They won’t show you what the gun is being pointed at. I’m not saying the army hasn’t done harm to innocents – I’m just saying it’s never just a matter of black and white, as the media would have you believe.

  

My father didn’t end up getting out of the car to buy the things he wanted; he asked the driver instead. He thought it would be too risky – even though this was the heart of Srinagar – a place that should be safe.

  

And that was it. That was my last "big" experience in Srinagar. When we went to the airport, I bought a few keychains of houseboats and my father had to abandon this powdery substance he had bought because such substances aren’t allowed on flights. I took a video of pigeons in the airport rather fanatically because that was the first time I had noticed pigeons in Kashmir (and they were indoors for some reason). When I looked at all the pictures I had taken a few days later, I saw pigeons in most of them. It occurred to me that I was so caught up in everything else I hadn’t noticed the pigeons at all.

*Now, I wear a Tilak for long hours, and a naervin for months on end. Because when I do it while I’m not in Kashmir, I won’t get shot for it.*
