<b>Shri Amit Shah</b>

<b>Dear Shri Shah,</b><br><br>

I am extremely concerned about the Jarawa tribe of the Andaman<br> Islands. The Supreme Court of India ordered in 2002 that the road<br> running through the Jarawa's reserve should be closed; yet it remains<br> open. The road brings the tribe into regular contact with settlers and<br> tourists who treat the Jarawa like animals in a human safari park.<br><br>

Poachers are also entering the Jarawa’s forest, hunting the animals the<br> tribe relies on. Both tourists and poachers risk bringing disease,<br> violence and exploitation to the tribe. Such contact could have<br> devastating consequences for the Jarawa, putting their survival as a tribe at risk.<br><br>

I urge you to ensure that the road is closed to all tourists, who must be<br> obliged to use the alternative sea route instead,  and the Jarawa<br> reserve is protected. The Jarawa must be allowed to make their own<br> decisions about their future, in their own time.<br><br>

Yours sincerely,<br>


Best Regards, <br>
