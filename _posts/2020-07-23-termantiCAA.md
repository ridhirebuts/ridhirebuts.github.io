title: The Term "Anti-CAA"
---

Shalom.
I am not here to inform you on the CAA, its pros, its cons or the controversies surrounding it. I am presently writing about it, and I will share my findings with you in due time. Today, I just want to talk about the term "Anti-CAA".

  

Anti is a Greek word, for "against" or "opposite". It's used in the English Language very often but in this case, it's been misused (in my opinion).

  

For those who don't know what the Citizenship Amendment Act is or need to jog their memory, this is the first part of it, word-for-word:

*"Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the [provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946](http://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1946-31.pdf) or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;".*

  

So this part of the CAA made it such that “any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014” would not be classified as an illegal immigrant (alongside the condition that they meet some additional basic criteria).

  

There was a lot of controversy about this part of the Act. Excluding the North-East protests (which would involve me delving into the NRC), the issues brought up during the other protests across India are that the Act:

1.  Discriminates on the basis of religion
    
2.  Was selective in deciding who is a refugee
